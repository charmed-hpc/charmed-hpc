# Terraform plans for deployment of Charmed HPC

Terraform for deploying a full Charmed HPC cluster using the Slurm workload manager.

The plans make use of the [Juju Terraform Provider](https://github.com/juju/terraform-provider-juju) to interact with a previously bootstrapped [Juju](https://juju.is) controller. A `justfile` is provided to simplify deployment through the [just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner and [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) infrastructure as code tool.

## ‚ú® Getting started

A Juju 3.x controller [bootstrapped](https://juju.is/docs/juju/bootstrapping) on your choice of cloud is required. Steps for deploying:

```shell
# Prerequisites
juju bootstrap <cloud name> <controller name>
sudo snap install --classic opentofu
sudo apt install just

# Deploy with a single command!
just deploy
```

* [Charmed HPC Documentation](https://canonical-charmed-hpc.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest)
* [Open an issue](https://github.com/charmed-hpc/charmed-hpc-terraform/issues/new?title=ISSUE+TITLE&body=*Please+describe+your+issue*)
* [Ask a question on the Charmed HPC GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/charmed-hpc/discussions/categories/q-a)

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

A useful command to help while hacking on the plans is:

```shell
just check  # Checks file formatting and syntax are valid.
```

or equivalent [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) commands:

```shell
tofu fmt -check -recursive      # Apply formatting standards to files.
tofu validate                   # Ensure files are syntactically valid.
```
